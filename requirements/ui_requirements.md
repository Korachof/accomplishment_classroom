# UI Requirements

This document is to detail the requirements needed for the UI for Accomplishment Classroom. In this first iteration, the UI will be a simple text-based one using Python and a version of TKinter that will be decided shortly (and updated here).

The UI will use a window set to a common resolution (1980x1080). Each new "page" of the app will be created via a new frame. This means there will need to be separate frames for each and every page/scene type.

An early version of the UI will be drawn and a copy will be added to the documentation when available. 

The UI will be a simple, clean design with good color contrast with accessibility in mind. The final details will be decided during the creation process.
