# accomplishment_storefront
A text-based inventory management game about buying and selling a variety of media, including video games, movies, TV shows, and books. Uses your real world accomplishments to create new inventory and unlock new features!

This game is a fun and strategic way to not only reach your goals as an owner of a local store, but to also keep track of all the media you consume. Simply finish something in the real world--a book, a movie, a tv series season, a video game--and then add it to the game. You'll automatically be given a copy of that piece of media in your inventory, and will also unlock the ability to buy more copies from the marketplace. 

Buy, sell, and collect your favorite video game consoles and pieces of media! Make mega profits as you grow your local business! Build relationships with different customers by having a variety of stock and offering good prices! With Accomplishment Storefront, both your real-life and virtual goals can be satisfied!
